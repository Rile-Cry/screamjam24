text = "Dad got selected for one of his “tests” I tried to stop them, but all the church goers pulled me away and Lena kept telling me how this will be a “blessing” for my father, I liked Lena, so I’m not the proudest in saying that I responded to her comment by punching her in the jaw. I screamed at dad to come with me as I ran to the door, but he didn’t even look at me, I wanted with every fiber of my being to stay there and fight for him, but I knew that whoever I was looking at, they weren’t my father. Some of the cultists chased after me, one nearly caught me until I was able to hit them in the eye with a rock. I’m going to try and contact brother, maybe he can figure this all out, or at least he can help me put a stop to this. "
