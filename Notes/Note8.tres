text = "I’ve started noticing people going missing, it’s almost like 1 person goes missing after every meeting, speaking of, they’ve only gone up in frequency, weekly meetings now to twice a week now they’re meeting every day, luckily because of this my parents have stopped caring to force me to go, whenever I ask them if they’ve noticed the missing people growing rampant they try to brush me off. Mom especially gets defensive whenever I bring up the subject."
