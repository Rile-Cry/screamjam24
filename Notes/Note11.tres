text = "I couldn’t let dad go alone, I tried to stop him from going, but it was like he didn’t even notice me trying to hold him back, and begging him to come back home, and so I was forced to attend this meeting with him. When we arrived I immediately asked the “priest” what happened last meeting, “What eventually happens to everyone.” he said ominously with a laugh. It was a mostly uneventful and seemingly business as usual for them, at the end another test occurred, I couldn’t stand watching this, I wanted to scream at the top of my lungs about how this man murdered my mother. But I managed to stay composed, Lena was chosen this time, she seemed happy, happier than I ever seen her, like usual the trial wasn’t witnessed, Andrei grabbed a book from his podium and put it on a cabinet in his office that caused it to move. Neither returned and everyone began to leave once the bookcase closed behind them."
