text = "This priest has practically taken over this village, ever since the church suddenly repaired over night, everyone quickly flocked to Dragos, some even pledging loyalty to this Mincinos right there. But it just seemed wrong to me, when I entered that church, it felt like I had eyes watching me everywhere, not from the actual people there, but from something empty, unfeeling. My feeling of dread only became more justified when I finally spotted the source of my fear, a doll, sitting in the rafters, when I finally registered what I was looking at, it vanished right before my eyes. On top of that Mom and dad are really beginning to buy into this more and more every day, mom even prays to him at every meal, dad hasnâ€™t quite gone that far yet but dad is attending their meetings, and keeps encouraging me to join, but I want to stay as far away from that place as possible.
